        <h2>Luanshya, Zambia – Copperbelt</h2>
        <img src="images/luanshya.jpeg" alt="View of Luanshya town">
        <p>Luanshya was established in the early 20th century as a mining town. Its name comes from the Luanshya River,
            which runs through the town. It grew rapidly due to copper mining and became one of Zambia's prominent
            mining centers. During the colonial period, it attracted workers from across Zambia and neighboring
            countries.</p>
